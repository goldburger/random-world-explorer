Overall Comments

- The proposal described intended advanced topics of generating terrain height using noise function, along with implementing collision detection for cannon shots with terrain. Fully implemented advanced features were terrain height using noise, and environment mapping using a cube map. Collision detection was attempted but not fully implemented.
- Project appears to have some bugs when viewed in Safari. Firefox or Chrome recommended.
