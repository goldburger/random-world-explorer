# Title?!?!?

## Final project for CS 174A, Introduction to Computer Graphics, UCLA Spring 2015
### Created by Matthew Goldberg, Zoe (Zhaoyuan) Xi, Shobhit Garg, Neil Bedi

[SNAZZY INTRODUCTION HELP PLS!!]
- The proposal described intended advanced topics of generating terrain height using noise function, along with implementing collision detection for cannon shots with terrain. Fully implemented advanced features were terrain height using noise, and environment mapping using a cube map. Collision detection was attempted but not fully implemented.

Directions: Do we need this?

Additional Comments: 
- Project appears to have some bugs when viewed in Safari. Works best on current versions of Firefox or Chrome.
- Our advanced topics include: terrains generated by noise, environmental mapping via a skybox (cube map), and collision detection(?)

### Individual Contributions + Additional Notes:

#### Matt Goldberg
* creation of texture images for cannon
* creation of HUD as an orthographic projection of a texture on top of scene
* code to initialize textures on different texture units
* skeleton for switching between buffers
* cone class for generating cone geometry
* creation of cannon from multiple cone instances and mapped textures
* cannon tracking mouse motion over canvas
* camera controls via mouse pointing for azimuth and altitude
* addition of Phong lighting on cannon from directional source
* debugging of skybox code

#### Zoe (Zhaoyuan) Xi
* in charge of all things environmental
* generated the terrain + skybox
* created the triangle strips mesh used to generate the terrain
* randomly generated the terrain's height using Ken Perlin's simplex noise algorithm. Resources used: ([1](http://staffwww.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf)) and ([2](https://gist.github.com/banksean/304522))
* texturized the environment via linear and mipmap filters
* implemented the surrounding skybox to encompass the player, camera, and terrain
* created the skybox via cube mapping (environmental mapping); kudos to Matt for helping me debug the cubebox code
* found the [images](http://www.custommapmakers.org/skyboxes.php) used to generate the skybox
* used Youtube and stressed a lot to learn about terrain and skybox generation ahaha. Highly recommend [ThinMatrix's] (https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix/playlists) GameDev Youtube channel for future CS 174A students :) 

#### Shobhit Garg
* blah blah

#### Neil Bedi
* created functionality for changing skybox on number key
* added background music with mute option
* implemented sound effects for controls
* used the [howler.js library](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library) for all music additions
* stylized webpage with CSS
* small fixes on player movement
* used the nifty [vivus.js library](https://maxwellito.github.io/vivus/) for animating the start logo
